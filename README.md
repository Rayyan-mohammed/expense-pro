# Project Title

**SaarthiAI – Voice-First AI Civic Access Platform for India**

## 1️⃣ Proposed Idea (What you’re building)

SaarthiAI is a voice-first, multilingual AI assistant that helps Indian citizens understand and access government schemes, public services, and community resources using simple questions and local languages.

Instead of searching confusing websites, users can:

- Speak or type in Hindi / regional language
- Answer basic questions (age, state, income range, need)

And instantly know:
- Which schemes they’re eligible for
- What documents are required
- How and where to apply
- Nearby public offices / help centers

Built for low digital literacy and low bandwidth users.

## 2️⃣ Why AWS (and which AWS services we’ll use)

This hackathon expects AWS usage,

### Core AWS Services

| Purpose             | AWS Service               | Why                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Hosting frontend    | AWS S3 + CloudFront       | Fast, scalable React hosting         |
| Backend APIs        | AWS Lambda                | Serverless, hackathon-friendly       |
| API routing         | Amazon API Gateway        | Connect frontend to backend          |
| AI / NLP            | Amazon Bedrock            | Secure LLM-based responses           |
| Language translation| Amazon Translate          | Regional language support            |
| Voice input/output  | Amazon Transcribe + Polly | Voice-first accessibility            |
| Data storage        | Amazon DynamoDB           | Fast NoSQL for schemes & user queries|
| Auth (optional)     | Amazon Cognito            | User login if needed                 |



## 3️⃣ Unique Solution & USP (Why this stands out)

**🔥 What makes SaarthiAI different?**

- **Voice-first, not text-first:** Most platforms assume users can read. SaarthiAI assumes they can speak.
- **Eligibility-based answers, not information dumps:** Instead of listing 100 schemes, it says: “Based on your profile, you are eligible for these 3.”
- **Local-language + low-bandwidth design:** Works even on basic devices, minimal UI, speech-based.
- **India-first data:** Focused on central + state schemes, not generic AI chat.

## 4️⃣ Existing Solutions (and their gaps)

**Existing Platforms:** MyGov portals, Government scheme websites, Generic chatbots, Google Search

**Problems with them:**

- Complex language
- English-heavy
- No personalization
- No voice interaction
- Too many clicks

👉 SaarthiAI solves access, not just information.

## 5️⃣ Project Flow / Architecture

### User Flow:

1. User opens React app
2. Speaks or types query (e.g., “I need scholarship help”)
3. Audio → Amazon Transcribe
4. Language → Amazon Translate
5. Query + profile → Amazon Bedrock
6. Eligible schemes fetched from DynamoDB
7. Response generated
8. Output via text + Amazon Polly (voice)

### Architecture (Simple):

React App  
   ↓  
API Gateway  
   ↓  
AWS Lambda  
   ↓  
Bedrock + Translate + DynamoDB  
   ↓  
Response → Polly → User

## 6️⃣ Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Web Speech API

### Backend:
- AWS Lambda (Node.js / Python)
- API Gateway

### AI & Language:
- Amazon Bedrock
- Amazon Translate
- Amazon Transcribe
- Amazon Polly

### Database:
- DynamoDB (schemes + metadata)

### Hosting:
- AWS S3 + CloudFront

## 7️⃣ Why This Matters for India 🇮🇳

- India has millions of eligible citizens who don’t access schemes
- Language + literacy are real barriers
- Smartphones exist, but UX is broken

This supports:
- Digital India
- Inclusive governance
- SDGs (education, poverty, equality)

This is not just an app — it’s digital inclusion.

- AI + AWS
- Real-world impact
- Product thinking
- Not a toy project
